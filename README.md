### State Management
- **Provider Pattern** - Chosen for its simplicity and Flutter team recommendation
- **Separation of Concerns** - Clear distinction between UI and business logic
- **Reactive UI** - UI automatically updates when state changes

### Data Persistence
- **SharedPreferences** - For cart data persistence
- **Local Storage** - All product data stored locally
- **JSON Serialization** - Proper data serialization/deserialization

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Flutter** - Latest stable version
- **Provider** - State management
- **SharedPreferences** - Local data persistence
- **Material Design** - UI components

## 📱 Screens

1. **Splash Screen** - App initialization
2. **Login/Signup** - User authentication
3. **Home Page** - Featured products and categories
4. **Products Screen** - Product list with search and filters
5. **Product Detail** - Detailed product information
6. **Cart Screen** - Shopping cart management

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Android/iOS emulator or physical device

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd grocery_mart_must_company_flutter_assesement
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] App launches successfully
- [ ] User can login/signup
- [ ] Products display correctly on home screen
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] Category filtering works
- [ ] Products can be added to cart
- [ ] Cart quantities can be adjusted
- [ ] Cart persists after app restart
- [ ] Checkout flow works

### Test Scenarios
1. **Cart Persistence**: Add items to cart, close app, reopen - items should still be there
2. **Search**: Search for "apple" - should show apple products
3. **Category Filter**: Select "Fruits" category - should show only fruits
4. **Quantity Management**: Add item, increment/decrement quantity, remove item
